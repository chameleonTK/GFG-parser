Welcome to The Noom's documentation!
====================================

The Noom |release| is a Syntax analyzer, a part of Compiler-compiler like `YACC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc/>`_ that based on `Parsing with Picture <http://apps.cs.utexas.edu/tech_reports/reports/tr/TR-2102.pdf/>`_ , Keshav Pingali and Gianfranco Bilardi

We use Grammar Flow Graph (GFG) as a representation of Context Free Grammar (CFG) to analyze grammar. GFG is tool that can reformulated parsing problem to the problem of finding certain kinds of path in graph so, It's make our Earley's Algorithm to be easier to understand.
