.. _installing-docdir:

Installing your doc directory
=============================

You may already have sphinx `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import sphinx'

If that fails grab the latest version of and install it with::

  > sudo easy_install -U Sphinx

Now you are ready to build a template for your docs, using
sphinx-quickstart::

  > sphinx-quickstart

accepting most of the defaults.  I choose "sampledoc" as the name of my
project.  cd into your new directory and check the contents::

  home:~/tmp/sampledoc> ls
  Makefile	_static		conf.py
  _build		_templates	index.rst

The index.rst is the master ReST for your project, but before adding
anything, let's see if we can build some html::

  make html

If you now point your browser to :file:`_build/html/index.html`, you
should see a basic sphinx site.

.. _fetching-the-data:

Fetching the data
-----------------

Now we will start to customize out docs.  Grab a couple of files from
the `web site <https://github.com/matplotlib/sampledoc>`_


.. py:function:: enumerate(sequence[, start=0])

   Return an iterator that yields tuples of an index and an item of the
   *sequence*. (And so on.)
